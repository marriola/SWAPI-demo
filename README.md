# SWAPI-demo

This is a small application that retrieves and displays Star Wars information from SWAPI (http://swapi.co). It started as an exercise in using Vue.js and became an exercise in ES6 development with a complete refactor. The application is now structured as a main entry point class with several controllers and a handful of utility classes.
